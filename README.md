## Approach
I began by simply getting a list populated with the information from a search of the Open Brewerys Database. One this was accomplished, I formatted each result as a card in a list separated by brewery type. This format displayed the relevant information correctly and reliably, but if a user wanted to see resutls from the second, third, or fourth sections of the list, they would need to scroll quite a distance, depending on the seach. To ease this difficulty, I refactored the code to display the result cards in four separate lists, separated as tabs. This way, users can see whichever kind of brewery they're specifically searchinf for immediately. 

Following this, I integrated the Google Maps Static API to allow users to request a pinned map of the area around a given brewery.
